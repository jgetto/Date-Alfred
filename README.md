#What's this about?

I got sick of firing up `node` or a browser JavaScript console for converting ms-since-epoch values to something I could actually understand.

This is a shortcut for:

    Î» node -pe '<a bunch of date formatting here>'

#Requirements

Alfred 2 (and obviously the PowerPack).

Requires [node](http://nodejs.org/) to be somewhere in a `$PATH` specified by `~/.profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc`. Sorry, Alfred shell script extensions don't load much by default.
